# 📊 3MTT Data Science Portfolio Project

Welcome to my **first official Data Science portfolio project** — inspired by the **3 Million Technical Talent (3MTT)** program. I completed this transformative training in 2024 under the **Data Science track**, where I learned the full data science workflow — from data cleaning to building machine learning models.

Recently, I decided to **revisit and apply the knowledge gained** in the program, and this project showcases two classification models: **Random Forest** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, along with key evaluation metrics.

## 🎯 About the 3MTT Program

The **3MTT (3 Million Technical Talent)** program is a national digital skilling initiative by the Federal Government of Nigeria, led by the Hon. Minister of Communications, Innovation and Digital Economy, **Dr. Bosun Tijani**.

I was privileged to be selected for the **Data Science course**, where I was trained in:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data visualization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical thinking
- Predictive modeling (Machine Learning)
- Data storytelling
- Real-world project building

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

This project is a **reflection of my progress** and practical application of concepts, including:

- ✅ Loading, preparing, and splitting datasets
- ✅ Training classification models using scikit-learn
- ✅ Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- ✅ Performance evaluation using classification metrics
- ✅ Data visualization with matplotlib

## 🔍 Project Highlights

### 🔹 Random Forest with GridSearchCV

**Goal**: Build a highly accurate classifier using the Random Forest algorithm and tune it for better performance.

**Steps I Took**:
- Loaded and cleaned data using `pandas`
- Built an initial `RandomForestClassifier` model
- Tuned hyperparameters like:
  - `n_estimators`
  - `max_depth`
  - `min_samples_split`
- Used `GridSearchCV` to automate the best parameter search
- Evaluated results with `classification_report`

📌 **Outcome**:
- Improved accuracy and reduced overfitting
- Learned how to interpret model behavior

### 🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Goal**: Use KNN to classify data and understand how distance-based models work.

**Steps I Took**:
- Implemented `KNeighborsClassifier` with `n_neighbors=3`
- Used test/train split to avoid data leakage
- Evaluated model with precision, recall, and F1-score

📈 **Results**:
- Accuracy: `91%`
- Macro Avg F1-Score: `83%`
